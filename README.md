# AAK-BackTesting-Toolkit
I built this repo to organize different backtesting frameworks for testing trading strategies. Each folder has a unique approachâ€”check its README.md for details. It's open-source, so feel free to use, tweak, or contribute. Hope it helps you refine your strategies as much as it helps me! ðŸš€
